# ani_cli_sub
Derivated from https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli (terminal program to see anime sub/dub on english), this project aims to allow not english fluent people to enjoy anime too. It uses the ani-cli tool for downloading sub and dub version, creates a new version with the sub audio and the dub video and embeds the subtitles from the opensubtitles api
